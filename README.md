Reactor JS is a highly modular and powerful framework designed to help you create custom web designs with much less code.


GETTING STARTED
To get started quickly, Reactor JS has only two dependencies. The Jquery library and Angular JS. Reactor utilizes Angular to load pages and allow them to communicate with each other. Reactor relies on this functionality to function properly.

The only other dependency is naturally Jquery, as Reactor JS is written in Jquery and Javascript.

WHAT IS REACTOR JS?
Reactor JS is a highly modular and powerful framework designed to help you create custom web designs with much less code.

The Reactor JS framework enables a web developer to build an instance of an html component and pass that component to another page where it is rendered as many times as you like. Then, initiating your variables as data-ids in your html elements, you can produce the required output.
